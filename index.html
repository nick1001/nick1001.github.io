	<h3><a name="crocker">Crocker's Rules</a></h3>

	<p>I declare Crocker's Rules. You may speak to me without politeness, convention, or PC. Further details below:

	<div class="details" style="border: 1px dashed gray; padding: 6px;">
	<p>Declaring yourself to be operating by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Crocker%27s_rules">Crocker's Rules</a>
	means that other people are allowed to optimize their messages for information,
	not for being nice to you. Crocker's Rules means that you have accepted
	full responsibility for the operation of your own mind - if you're offended,
	it's your fault. Anyone is allowed to call you a moron and claim
	to be doing you a favor. (Which, in point of fact, they would be.
	One of the big problems with this culture is that everyone's afraid to
	tell you you're wrong, or they think they have to dance around it.)
	Two people using Crocker's Rules should be able to communicate all relevant
	information in the minimum amount of time, without paraphrasing or social
	formatting. Obviously, don't declare yourself to be operating by
	Crocker's Rules unless you have that kind of mental discipline.</p>
	<p>Note that Crocker's Rules does <i>not</i> mean you can insult people;
	it means that <i>other</i> people don't have to worry about whether <i>they</i>
	are insulting <i>you</i>. Crocker's Rules are a discipline, not
	a privilege. Furthermore, taking advantage of Crocker's Rules does
	not imply reciprocity. How could it? Crocker's Rules are something
	you do for yourself, to maximize information received - <i>not</i> something
	you grit your teeth over and do as a favor.
