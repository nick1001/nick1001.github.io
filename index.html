	<h3><a name="crocker">Crocker's Rules</a></h3>

	<p>	I declare Crocker's Rules. You may speak to me without politeness, convention, or PC. Further details below:

	<div class="details" style="border: 1px dashed gray; padding: 6px;">
	<p>Declaring yourself to be operating by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Crocker%27s_rules">Crocker's Rules</a>
	means that other people are allowed to optimize their messages for information,
	not for being nice to you. Crocker's Rules means that you have accepted
	full responsibility for the operation of your own mind - if you're offended,
	it's your fault. Anyone is allowed to call you a moron and claim
	to be doing you a favor. (Which, in point of fact, they would be.
	One of the big problems with this culture is that everyone's afraid to
	tell you you're wrong, or they think they have to dance around it.)
	Two people using Crocker's Rules should be able to communicate all relevant
	information in the minimum amount of time, without paraphrasing or social
	formatting. Obviously, don't declare yourself to be operating by
	Crocker's Rules unless you have that kind of mental discipline.</p>
	<p>Note that Crocker's Rules does <i>not</i> mean you can insult people;
	it means that <i>other</i> people don't have to worry about whether <i>they</i>
	are insulting <i>you</i>. Crocker's Rules are a discipline, not
	a privilege. Furthermore, taking advantage of Crocker's Rules does
	not imply reciprocity. How could it? Crocker's Rules are something
	you do for yourself, to maximize information received - <i>not</i> something
	you grit your teeth over and do as a favor.
	</div>

	<h3>New Day Policy</h3>
	<p>Each day is a new beginning. I hold no grudges and harbor no enemies. It is safe to assume I have reset myself after one sleep cycle.</p>


	<h3><a name="ping">Ping</a></h3>
	<p>If I send '<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.jargon.net/jargonfile/p/ping.html">ping</a>', the communication is time sensitive. The traditional response is 'pong'.</p>

	<h3>Real-time Communication</h3>

	<p>Preferably <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://t.me/nickflyer">Telegram</a>. Secondarily, phone/SMS at 7l3-26l-O73O.</p>

	<h2><a name="social">Section 2: Social</a></h2>
	<!--
	<p>Being an introvert, I prefer my pool of close friends to be limited in number and high in quality. My friend pool is larger than I could ever manage and a delicate equilibrium exists between
	those being actively engaged and those remaining a phone call away.</p>
	-->


	<div class="details" style="border: 1px dashed gray; padding: 6px;">
	<ol>
		<li>NAME PRONUNCIATION: Zelig, pronounced however you'd like, even Bob is fine.</li><p></p>

		<li>Don't take me too seriously when I play <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=devil%27s%20advocate">devil's advocate</a>. If you can't argue opposing views, you don't fully understand either.</li><p></p></li>

		<li>Being <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness_%28psychology%29">mindful</a> and decent are important to me. I expect both.</li><p></p>

		<li>I've my own set of values, beliefs, and morality, and I exercise my judgment. =)</li><p></p>

		<li>I'm [E/I]NTP-A and my humor is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dry%20humour">dry</a>. Think Ben Stein.</li><p></p>

	<p></p>



	<h2><a name="love">Section 3: Love Life</a></h2>
	<p>I prefer the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyamory">primary/secondary model</a> and a single primary life-long partnership. I don't easily pick up on interest or advancements, so subtlety and passiveness aren't the best approach. The use of <a href="#crocker">Crocker's Rules</a> is always welcome. Regarding consent and myself, no means no, maybe means maybe, yes means yes, and silence whatever you'd like it to mean.</p>
