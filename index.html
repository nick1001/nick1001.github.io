	<h3><a name="crocker">Crocker's Rules</a></h3>

	<p>	I declare Crocker's Rules. You may speak to me without politeness, convention, or PC. Further details below:

	<div class="details" style="border: 1px dashed gray; padding: 6px;">
	<p>Declaring yourself to be operating by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Crocker%27s_rules">Crocker's Rules</a>
	means that other people are allowed to optimize their messages for information,
	not for being nice to you. Crocker's Rules means that you have accepted
	full responsibility for the operation of your own mind - if you're offended,
	it's your fault. Anyone is allowed to call you a moron and claim
	to be doing you a favor. (Which, in point of fact, they would be.
	One of the big problems with this culture is that everyone's afraid to
	tell you you're wrong, or they think they have to dance around it.)
	Two people using Crocker's Rules should be able to communicate all relevant
	information in the minimum amount of time, without paraphrasing or social
	formatting. Obviously, don't declare yourself to be operating by
	Crocker's Rules unless you have that kind of mental discipline.</p>
	<p>Note that Crocker's Rules does <i>not</i> mean you can insult people;
	it means that <i>other</i> people don't have to worry about whether <i>they</i>
	are insulting <i>you</i>. Crocker's Rules are a discipline, not
	a privilege. Furthermore, taking advantage of Crocker's Rules does
	not imply reciprocity. How could it? Crocker's Rules are something
	you do for yourself, to maximize information received - <i>not</i> something
	you grit your teeth over and do as a favor.

	<h3><a name="ping">Ping</a></h3>
	<p>If I send '<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.jargon.net/jargonfile/p/ping.html">ping</a>', the communication is time sensitive. The traditional response is 'pong'.</p>

	<h3>Real-time Communication</h3>
	<p>Preferably <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://t.me/nickflyer">Telegram</a>. Secondarily, phone/SMS at 7l3-26l-O73O.</p>
	<br>

	<h2><a name="social">Section 2: Social</a></h2>
		<h3>Name Pronunciation</h3>
		<p>Zélɑk is nice but pronounce it as you'd like. Even Bob works. I prefer hearing the variety among different circles.</p>

		<h3>New Day Policy</h3>
		<p>Each day is a new beginning. I hold no grudges and harbor no enemies. It is safe to assume I have reset myself after one sleep cycle.</p>


		<h3>Practiced Values</h3>
			<li style="text-indent: 10px">At worse, leave no trace, but try to leave it better than you found it.</li>
			<!--“You must leave this world a better place than it would have been if you had not existed.” ‒ Isabel Wilkerson
			Every man is bound to leave a story better than how he found it.-->
			<li style="text-indent: 10px">Do not do to others what you know has hurt yourself. ‒ Kural 316</li>
			<li style="text-indent: 10px">Being <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness_%28psychology%29">mindful</a> of one's self and aiming towards being a decent human being are important to me. I expect this of others.</li>

			<p> I play <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=devil%27s%20advocate">devil's advocate</a>, so don't always take me too seriously. If you can't argue opposing views, you don't fully understand either. My humor is dry and I am full of sarcasm so it can be difficult to tell when I am being serious and when I am joking. If you'd like to know, just ask. </p>

<!--<h2><a name="love">Section 3: Love Life</a></h2>
				<p>Monogamy by default.</p> -->
